<p>Fire Protection and Safety systems are vital to companies of every size, and they trust their service provider to deliver on-time maintenance and repair of these systems to keep their locations and property safe. As the provider, you want to retain customers by providing the best possible service at the lowest price.</p>
<p>With ServiceTrade, you can do both. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximize job service density</strong> - When you know which jobs need to be done during a certain time period, you can complete a number of services at one time, minimizing extra visits to customer locations and keeping costs down.</li>
<li><strong>Provide detailed deficiency reports</strong> - By using photos and audio memos documenting deficient assets, you can quickly bring problems to your customer's attention and increase your quote approval by as much as 50%.</li>
<li><strong>Map-based scheduling and routing</strong> - Using the ServiceTrade scheduler, you can assign technicians to jobs in nearby areas and quickly respond to urgent requests; now you can provide customers with an estimated time of arrival thanks to our GPS-based job clock.</li>
</ul>
